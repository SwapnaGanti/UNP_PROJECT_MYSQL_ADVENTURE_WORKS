# UNP_PROJECT_MYSQL_ADVENTURE_WORKS

Completed this project as part of My SQL Internship with United Network of Professionals(UNP).

OVERVIEW:
The AdventureWorks database is a sample database provided by Microsoft, designed to showcase the features of SQL Server. It simulates a fictional bicycle manufacturer named Adventure Works Cycles, with tables representing various aspects of the business, including products, sales, customers, and employees.

Products: The database contains information about different products offered by Adventure Works, including bicycles, accessories, and components. This includes details such as product names, categories, and prices.
Sales: It tracks sales transactions, including the date of sale, customer information, and the products purchased. This data can be used to analyze sales performance over time, identify popular products, and track revenue.
Customers: The database includes customer information such as names, addresses, and contact details. This data can be used for customer segmentation, marketing analysis, and understanding customer demographics.
Employees: Adventure Works employs a team of staff, and the database stores information about employees, including their roles, departments, and contact information.
Orders and Order Details: Detailed information about individual orders, including order dates, quantities, and prices, is stored in the database. This data can be used to analyze order patterns, track order fulfillment, and calculate order totals.
Territories: Adventure Works operates in multiple regions, and the territories table stores information about sales territories, including territory names and region details.
Product Categories and Subcategories: Products are organized into categories and subcategories, providing a hierarchical structure for organizing inventory and facilitating product analysis.
